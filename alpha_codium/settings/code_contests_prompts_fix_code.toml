You are given a code contest problem:
=============
{{ description|trim }}
=============

a self-reflection on the problem:
======
{{ self_reflection|trim }}
======

and an Algorithm for the problem:
=============
{{ s_best_solution_str|trim }}
=============

The code below is an implementation of the algorithm. But its output on a test input is wrong:

Code:
=================
{{code|trim}}
=================

Test input:
=====================
5 2
AA
AB
BB
BA
AZ
=====================
Test output:
====================
5 2 1 3 4
====================

Code output:
====================
1 2 3 4 5
====================

Your task is to correct the code, according to the following analysis of the call stack:

Analysis of call stack:
===================
{{callstack_analysis|trim}}
===================

Guidelines:
- The correction should be based on the analysis of call stack.
- Give the whole new code.
- Make just the necessary changes. Keep the program structure, if possible.
- Keep the comments intact. Except that a comment is wrong, where you should correct it.
- The code should read the input using the 'input()' method. The output should be printed without additional words using the 'print()' method.
