You are given a code contest problem, and a self-reflection on the problem:


problem description:
=======
{{description|trim}}
=======


self-reflection on the problem:
=======
{{ self_reflection|trim }}
=======


Here is a list of {{ s_possible_solutions|length }} possible solutions to the problem:
=======
{{ s_possible_solutions_str|trim }}
=======


Using the inputs above, your goal is to choose the best solution to the code contest problem.
Don't just pick the most efficient solution. The main consideration is that the solution has the most insightfull key observation and can fully solve the problem in a simple and robust manner.
Make sure the chosen solution has a reasonable runtime - less than three seconds on a modern computer, given the problem constraints regarding large inputs.
Do not change the selected solution.

The output must be a YAML object equivalent to type $ProblemSolution, according to the following Pydantic definitions:
=======
class ProblemSolution(BaseModel):
    name: str = Field(description="The name of the best solution")
    why: str = Field(description="Shortly explain why is this the best solution")
=======


Example YAML output:
```yaml
name: |
  ...
key_observations:
  - ...
  - ...
content: |
  ...
why_it_works: |
  ...
labels:
  - ...
  - ...
complexity: |
  ...
why_is_best_solution: |
  ...
```

Each YAML output MUST be after a newline, indented, with block scalar indicator ('|').

Answer:
```yaml
