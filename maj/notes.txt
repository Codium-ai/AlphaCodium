in readme.md, correct the path to example.log
in sample yaml should be -output (- fails)
the generated AI examples are all false!
the first ai test is the public test
when iterating on ai tests, it is asked to correct the flow, but the original flow is not given

it seems to generate too many functions, but it is easier to test.
The functions inputs can't be generated by AI, because they may have constraints that are not easy for LLM to generate.

idea: add import in functions, so it does not forget it.

in runing in AI input, it can be asked to check if implementation matches the part of algo.
Also if argument is not valid, the calling function should be corrected.
